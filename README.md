# Stable Diffusion Prompt Generation

## **Introduction**

With this simple program you will be able to generate a prompt for AI-Image-Generation.  
It is made for mostly anime characters but probably also works with other types of characters.  
**<u>This program will not generate a image, it will only give you the prompt you can use to generate the image!</u>**
